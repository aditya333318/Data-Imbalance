# 📊 Handling Class Imbalance Using SMOTE & Oversampling

## 🔍 Overview
This project addresses the **class imbalance problem in machine learning** by applying **oversampling techniques**, including **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**. The objective is to improve **minority class prediction performance** and build more **robust and fair classification models** using Python.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Imbalanced datasets often cause machine learning models to:
- Favor the majority class
- Miss important minority class instances
- Produce misleading accuracy metrics

This project focuses on **balancing the dataset** to improve recall, precision, and overall model reliability, especially for real-world applications such as **fraud detection, healthcare analytics, and risk modeling**.
